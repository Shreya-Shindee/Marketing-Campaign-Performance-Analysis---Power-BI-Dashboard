1.  **Get Data:
    * Open Power BI Desktop.
    * Click `Get Data` on the Home ribbon.
    * Select `Text/CSV`.
    * Browse to and select `marketing_campaign_data_cleaned.csv`.
    * Click `Load`. (Power BI often detects data types well, but it's good practice to check in the next step).

2.  **Transform Data (Optional but Recommended):
    * Click `Transform data` on the Home ribbon to open Power Query Editor.
    * Check Data Types: Ensure `Date` is Date type, numerical columns (Impressions, Clicks, Cost, Revenue, Profit, CTR (%), CPC, Conversion Rate (%), ROI (%)) are Decimal Number or Whole Number as appropriate, and text columns (Channel, Region, Campaign_ID) are Text type. Adjust if necessary.
    * Check for any remaining errors or inconsistencies.
    * Click `Close & Apply`.

3.  **Build Visualizations:

    * **a) KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
        * Use `Card` visuals (from the Visualizations pane).
        * Drag `Revenue` to the Fields area of the first Card. Click the dropdown on the field and select `Sum`. Title it "Total Revenue". Format as currency.
        * Create another Card. Drag `CTR (%)` to the Fields area. Select `Average`. Title it "Avg. CTR". Format as percentage.
        * Create another Card. Drag `ROI (%)` to the Fields area. Select `Average`. Title it "Avg. ROI". Format as percentage.
        * Create another Card. Drag `Cost` to the Fields area. Select `Sum`. Title it "Total Cost". Format as currency.

    * **b) Channel Performance:
        * Use a `Clustered bar chart` or `Clustered column chart`.
        * Axis/Y-axis: Drag `Channel`.
        * Values/X-axis: Drag `Revenue` (Sum), `CTR (%)` (Average), `ROI (%)` (Average). You might want separate charts for clarity or use tooltips. A common approach is one chart for Revenue/Cost and another for Rates (CTR/ROI).
        * Example: Bar chart with `Channel` on Y-axis and `Sum of Revenue` on X-axis.

    * **c) Region-wise Map:
        * Use a `Map` visual (the basic one or Filled Map).
        * Location: Drag `Region`.
        * Bubble size / Color saturation: Drag `Revenue` (Sum) or `ROI (%)` (Average). Adjust aggregation as needed.

    * **d) Time-series Performance:
        * Use a `Line chart`.
        * Axis: Drag `Date`. Power BI will create a hierarchy (Year, Quarter, Month, Day). You can use this or just the Date field. Drill down to Month level for a monthly trend.
        * Values: Drag `Revenue` (Sum) and `Cost` (Sum).

    * **e) Slicers (Filters):
        * Use `Slicer` visuals.
        * Create slicers for `Channel`, `Region`, and `Date` (use the 'Between' setting for date range).

4.  **Arrange and Format:
    * Arrange the visuals logically on the canvas.
    * Apply formatting (titles, colors, labels) for readability and aesthetic appeal.
    * Save your Power BI report (.pbix file).
